# CTF Writeups

Welcome to my repository of Capture The Flag (CTF) competition writeups. This repository contains detailed walkthroughs, solutions, and insights from various CTF challenges I have participated in. The purpose of these writeups is to share knowledge, solutions, and techniques used during the competitions.

## Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a specific CTF event. Inside each event's folder, you'll find subfolders for each category of challenges such as `Web`, `API`, `WindowsPrivEsc`, `LinuxPrivEsc`, etc., depending on what challenges were available in the event.
